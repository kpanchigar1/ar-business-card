# How to use the AR Business Card Application
1. Open up your phone’s camera (or QR code scanner) and scan the marker below.
2. Keep the marker in view while the website loads.
3. Once the website has loaded, you will be presented with a screen containing an overview of the card owner, and the option to pick a language of your choice.
4. Once you’ve picked a language, you’ll be able to interact with the AR Business Card™.
5. Use the **O** cursor in the middle of the viewport to select AR objects on your screen.
6. You can ask a custom question using the “Ask your own question…” popup at the top (Currently a WIP)
